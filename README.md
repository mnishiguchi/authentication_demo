# Authentication demo

This is the example web application for demonstrating a simple authentication system. Most of ideas are adopted from

### The method for authenticating users
By comparing hashed values instead of raw passwords, we will be able to authenticate users without storing the passwords themselves. This means that, even if our database is compromised, our usersâ€™ passwords will still be secure.

1. Take a submitted password
2. Hash it
3. Compare the result to the hashed value stored in the database
4. If the two match, then the submitted password is correct and the user is authenticated.
